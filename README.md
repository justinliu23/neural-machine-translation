## Features
- Advanced neural machine translation with an attention mechanism to accurately translate human-readable dates into machine-readable formats.
- Detailed visualizations of the attention weights to enhance understanding of the model's decision-making process.

## Installation
Ensure the following Python packages are installed to run the notebook:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow tqdm Faker
```
Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the notebook.

## Usage
Open and run the notebook cells sequentially to train the neural translation model. The notebook includes step-by-step explanations and visualizations to aid in understanding each process and the effectiveness of the attention mechanism.

## Configuration
No additional configuration is needed beyond the standard library installations.

## Model Architecture
The notebook details a sequence-to-sequence architecture incorporating an encoder, a decoder, and an attention mechanism that focuses on important parts of the input sequence to improve the accuracy of translations.

## Dataset
Includes 10,000 automatically generated pairs of dates, showcasing various human-readable formats converted to a standardized machine-readable format.

## Results
Comprehensive analysis and visualization of model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the attention mechanism across different date formats.
